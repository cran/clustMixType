...tbds:  
          - check and fix PR #16 by ztime: Fix for different levels in training data and x.
          - add test for allNAs and kproto_gower
          - check NA treatment (argument + remove of NAs, ln 133ff + are they ignored if na.rm=F?)
          - migrate to 0.4-1 (after missing, gower and initialization updates)
          - maybe add variable importance (LO/perm) to post-validate selection od lambda 
          - check -itemize environment in validation_kproto.Rd (v0.3-14)
    
    
          -	clprofiles(): 
            1) add legends for factors
            2) check additional input parameter for a) w/o ask = T  b) specify mfrow/mfcol for simultaneous plots of several variables (+ add error check for this option if # of variables does not match grid)
            ...is there aby potential impact on plot.kproto?
          - try to remember why has there been clprofiles and not plot.kproto so far? (...x argument for keep.data = F? )
